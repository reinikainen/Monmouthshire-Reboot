This is the repository for the open source Monmouthshire 3.0 DNA Reboot Programme.

The Monmoutshire 3.0 DNA Reboot Programme is collection of projects that seek to genetically reengineer the DNA of our local authority to transform it and its people into a 21st century public service.  We also aim to establish a model for public service reform and to make that source code available to other public authorities and the wider world.

Anyone is free to view the source code.  If you would like to contribute to the project, please send an email outlining your motivation and particular area of interest to <esko at reinikainen.co.uk> with MON30CONTRIBUTE in the subject line.

We particularly welcome interest from people with an interest or expertise in the following areas:

Public Service Reform
Design Thinkers
Open Source
Open Data
Open Government
Disruptive Innovation

The first projects in this programme of works are: 
1. Monmouthshire Intrapreneurship School
2. Open Data Roadmap
